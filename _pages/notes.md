*“I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space.” ― Hamlet*

Preface
===

In July 2020, I walked into the realm of advanced MATH. However, it wasn’t until I read *Topology* by *Munkres* and *Algebra* by *Hungerford* during the Winter of 2021 that I realized it’s overwhelming. The concepts and theorems in these books proved to be challenging, prompting me to take inspiration from *Kunihiko Kodaira* and develop my own approach to learning MATH.

> The notes below were made when I was studying at WHU. In addition to them, my courseworks at WHU w.r.t. Math/Stat/CS also contain: Numerical Analysis, C Language, Sampling Survey, Number Theory, Mathematical Logic, R Language and Statistics Computing.
