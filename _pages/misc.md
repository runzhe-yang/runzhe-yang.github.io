*“要多想。” ― 《三体》*

*Interesting Quizzes*
===

Q1: For two sequence of r.v.'s *(Xn)* and *(Yn)* independent in a same probability space. If *Xn→X,Yn→Y* both in distribution. Do you think *Xn+Yn→X+Y* in distribution?
   >Think it carefully. You can modify the statement and make it more tricky.
    
Q2: How to prove any two families of o.n.b of one Hilbert space have the same cardinality?
   >You will find sth amazing in definition of "SUM".

Q3: Do you really think *p(θ∈(a,b))∈{0,1}* for some parameter *θ*?
   >This is an essential difference between a Bayesian and a Frequenist. I have to say: I am totally a Bayesian. 

Q4: For a given r.v. X, could you find a r.v. Y st. it’s i.i.d. as X?
> Generally, we require the probability space to be nonatomic to guaratee the indepedence will hold. And You can search for a THM called Skorokhod's 
      Representation THM, which is one of my most favourite THM in Probability.

Q5: For a n.v.s *E. F* is a close subspace, is there a *m* in *F* st. *d(x,F)=d(x,m)*? 
   >There's a sufficient and necessary condition for its holding.

Q6: Do you think one transition function can correspond one CTMC? What's about one generator and one CTMC?
   >It first amazes me because it's a simple example that satisfies strong Markov property but not a Feller process. (Actually, Feller property is a stronger property     than merely strong Markov) If you are interested in this question, you can search for a process called Blackwell process.

Q7: What's the dual space of *R^∞* equipped with box topology?
   >Can you recall the definition of dual space? You can think it algebracally rather than analysisly.(hint: search for concepts: inductive limit and projective 
    limit)

**Mein Glück**

*–Friedrich Nietzsche*

*“Seit ich des Suchens müde ward,*

*“自从厌倦于追寻，*

*Erlernte ich das Finden.*

*我已学会一觅即中。*

*Seit mir ein Wind hielt Widerpart,*

*自从一股逆风袭来，*

*Segl’ ich mit allen Winden.”*

*我已能抵御八面来风架舟而行。”*
