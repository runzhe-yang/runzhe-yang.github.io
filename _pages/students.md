> **Advertisement**: I'm happy to hold (remote/in-person) visitors, my previous visitors are [here](https://2prime.github.io/students/). Please read [For Prospective Students](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PGZgc0EcAZrYt7PxAo7_jLOPztWU3Fko5gYq0bXtMnc/edit?usp=sharing) before emailing me. Attaching a slide/review that provides a high-level overview of potential directions for our work together is a bonus item！

> Due to the large amount of emails, I may miss some of the emails. **The best way to approach me is by filling out the [form](https://forms.gle/BaUYbUx35RL4zD3R6)**. If you want to do a summer intern, please remember to email me!
> 
> **For Ph.D. Applicants** I'm actively looking for Ph.D. students starting in Fall 2024. Although Ph.D. admissions to Northwestern IEMS are handled at a department-wide level, not by me individually, candidates with undergraduate backgrounds in applied mathematics/computational physics, computer science, or statistics are encouraged to contact me by email with the following documentation:
> - a current CV, which should include your previous research projects
> - Short answer to the questions in [For Prospective Students](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PGZgc0EcAZrYt7PxAo7_jLOPztWU3Fko5gYq0bXtMnc/edit?usp=sharing)
> - A slide/review that provides a high-level overview of potential directions for our work together, with an emphasis on areas of overlap between our interests. (theoretical/computational are both welcome)

I will dedicate 30 mins every week for junior PhD/master/undergraduate students, if you would like to chat about life, career plan, or research ideas related to AI/ML, feel free to email me to schedule a meeting. I encourage students from underrepresented groups to reach out and will prioritize these meetings.
