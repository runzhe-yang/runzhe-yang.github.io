**1.Lower Bound for Disconnection of Vacant Set in Loop Percolation**

Supervisor: *[Prof. Dr. Maximilian Nitzschner](https://www.math.hkust.edu.hk/~mnitzschner/)*

*May 2023 — June 2024, HKUST*

The principal aim of this project is to derive asymptotic lower on the probability that in a certain model of random walk loops on the integer lattice, a macroscopic set is disconnected from infinity by the trace of the loops. We also investigate the large deviation for occupation time field of loop soup.
