*“Le vent se lève, il faut tenter de vivre.” ― Paul Valéry*

Short Bio
===

My name is **Yang, Runzhe (杨润哲)**. The Chinese character “润” means nourishing or abundant, while “哲” was chosen by my parents with the hope that I would always think rationally and calmly. Alternatively, you can call me *Reiny (Yang)* directly.

I am currently a first-year phase I student majoring in Stochastics & Finance at [Ph.D. program](https://www.math-berlin.de/about-bms/bms-phd-program) of *[Berlin Mathematical School(HU/TU/FU)](https://www.math-berlin.de/about-bms)*, supervised by *[Prof. Dr. Peter Friz](https://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~friz/)*, on the way of being a probabilist. Prior to that, I got my B.Sc. degree at *[the School of Mathematics and Statistics](http://maths.whu.edu.cn/Englishversion/index.htm)*, *[Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/)*.  During my undergraduate period, I was very fortune to work with *[Prof. Dr. Maximilian Nitzschner](https://www.math.hkust.edu.hk/~mnitzschner/)* at *[Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.hkust.edu.hk/), [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/)*. 

I was born in Chaoshan region and grew up in Huizhou, Guangdong in Southern China.

My primary research interests lie in the area involving Probability and Analysis.
