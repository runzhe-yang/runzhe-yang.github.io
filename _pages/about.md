*“Le vent se lève, il faut tenter de vivre.” ― Paul Valéry*

Short Bio
===

My name is **Yang, Runzhe (杨润哲)**. The Chinese character “润” means nourishing or abundant, while “哲” was chosen by my parents with the hope that I would always think rationally and calmly. Alternatively, you can call me *Reiny (Yang)* directly.

I am now a fourth-year undergraduate student at *[the School of Mathematics and Statistics](http://maths.whu.edu.cn/Englishversion/index.htm)*, *[Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/)*, majoring in Statistics and Probability, on the way of being a probabilist.

I was born in Chaoshan region and grew up in Huizhou, Guangdong in Southern China.

**My primary research interests lie in the area involving Probability and Analysis.**

See my CV [here](../files/cv.pdf).
